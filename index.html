              <p>Who would have thought that a teenager could have a successful career creating makeup tutorial videos on YouTube? For Lacey Robbins, this dream has been her reality. An up-and-coming YouTuber, she has thousands of fans and can't wait for the day when her subscriber count reaches the one million mark. And when she is offered a high school internship at On Trend Magazine, she figures that this could be the make it or break it moment.</p>
              <p>But sometimes your dream job isn't all that it seems. Her editor is only interested in promoting junk products, and her boss in the Hair and Makeup department introduces her to the larger world of makeup artistry, making her wonder if making tutorials online is all she is meant to do. To top it all off, when the magazine's feature subject , musician Tyler Lance, turns his broodingly handsome smile her way, falling for him could mean losing her fans, forcing her to make a decision: her YouTube life or her real life?</p>
              <p>Fans of Zoella's GIRL ONLINE will fall right into the world of this YA DEVIL WEARS PRADA and stay hooked from the first blush to the last glossy kiss.</p>

             <p>Beth Ellyn Summer fell in love with writing fiction as a way to process the real world. Thanks to her time spent in college interning for two late night talk show moguls, all her books encompass elements of fame, comedy, and television. She's not saying the incidents depicted in her novels aren't not true, but she's not saying they're false, either. (Hey, she had to get something out of the experience besides fetching coffee for a year straight!) In any case, it's therapeutic to share.</p>
             <p>Beth thinks laughter is the greatest gift on earth. If we all laughed more, we could achieve world peace. She loves it so much she can't even think of something funny to say about it. So if you LOL just once while reading her books, then her job is done.</p>
             <p>Beth lives in New York, where any chance at viewing the aurora borealis is endlessly thwarted by pollution and trees. When she's not writing, Beth is working out, watching <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>, listening to Taylor Swift, and spending time with her cat, Penny. Sometimes all at once! Because multitasking is the new self-care. </p>
